# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the process of setting up Deno,
# running lint checks, and executing tests on a repository. It triggers on push and
# pull request events to the 'main' branch. The workflow includes the following steps:
#
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the 'step-security/harden-runner' action to enhance the security
#    of the GitHub Actions runner by auditing egress traffic.
#
# 2. Setup repo: Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to check out the repository's code.
#
# 3. Setup Deno: Uses the 'denoland/setup-deno' action to install Deno with the specified
#    version (v1.x).
#
# 4. Run linter: Executes 'deno lint' to perform linting on the codebase.
#
# 5. Run tests: Executes 'deno test -A' to run tests with all permissions.
#
# Additionally, there is an optional step to verify code formatting using 'deno fmt --check',
# which is currently commented out.
#
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow will install Deno then run `deno lint` and `deno test`.
